I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our community. Perhaps you have been invited, you stumbled across our site or you've heard about us from a friend and decided to check us out. Either way, I don't believe that life is just random so therefore I believe that you are here by appointment. Today, could be the start of a whole new adventure for you but the choice is always yours. 

When you look back at your journey thus far and think of all the teachings about the secrets to creating a life of success, abundance, well-being and fulfillment, there is one   
question that I believe comes up more than any other...  
"Why aren't all these personal development strategies working for you with the same power it does for others even though you might be trying as hard or even harder than they do?"  
You may even have practiced plenty of really powerful spiritual and self growth tools and rituals that were proven to change the lives of others.   
Then why do you still feel like they're not working well enough for you? Or why do you still feel like there's a block preventing   
you from living your best life?

Perhaps the answer is not in the tools but in the individual that wields the tools. A tool is just that. It is like uploading good software onto a bad piece of hardware. 

Ignite Life exists so that you can make the choice to take the journey in discovering who you truly are. It's not a mystery...you are incredible and you have been destined for great things but sometimes we fall asleep at the wheel and we're heading for a crash.

It's time to come alive....and create the future.
