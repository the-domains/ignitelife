            <description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our community. Perhaps you have been invited, you stumbled across our site or you've heard about us from a friend and decided to check us out. Either way, I don't believe that life is just random so therefore I believe that you are here by appointment. Today, could be the start of a whole new adventure for you but the choice is always yours. </p>]]></description>
